- DONE the TAS in the UI output is high as compared to the simulation.  it seems that the average cruise speed is calculated in corectlty.  in the UI output sectio of cruise, add he highest achieved Mach during the cruise segment.
- DONE we need a nice airport table at the top of UI output.  it is not very clean.  provide the pressure altitude and density altitude of the airports and make the table nice.
 -the total distances are off, which means there is some trig problems with or without wind
-we need to write a nice PDF output of the results if the user wants it. just like the UI output, almost like a screen copy,  i tried this once and it was really bad.  the plots wouldnt show up and it never got fixed.  please take a effective approach so that we are not in an endless loop.  
-better search for airports
