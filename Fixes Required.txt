- DONE the TAS in the UI output is high as compared to the simulation.  it seems that the average cruise speed is calculated in corectlty.  in the UI output sectio of cruise, add he highest achieved Mach during the cruise segment.
- DONE we need a nice airport table at the top of UI output.  it is not very clean.  provide the pressure altitude and density altitude of the airports and make the table nice.
DONE-the total distances are off, which means there is some trig problems with or without wind
-we need to write a nice PDF output of the results if the user wants it. just like the UI output, almost like a screen copy,  i tried this once and it was really bad.  the plots wouldnt show up and it never got fixed.  please take a effective approach so that we are not in an endless loop.  
-better search for airports
- ROC min is 300 but the code says 400
-allow for cruise climb once level
DONE-introduce max range, and max endurance settings, so after the climb to altitude, the speed is set to get the proper CL over CD relationship, an that is maintianed throughtout the cruise segment of flight, with the minimum set at 1.2 of the on condition stalling speed.  the UI should ask, MCT for max thrust, Max Range, or Max endurance.
Done target altitude on range vs altitude, legend should say target altitude
 DONE i would like a summary table for the single-run mode, that displays the fuel burn in lbs, for each hour of the mission.  like Tamarack burned 700 pph for the first, then 643 the second etc.  then same for the flatwing.  this should be the last section of the UI output.
DONE in the payload-range output plots to the folder, in the title put "FL410 Goal" instead of FL410, to acknowledge that the aircraft may not be able to get there
DONE the autobias doesnt change for the Tamarack
the szt to sjt flatwing can't make it in reality, but the sim says yes.  but earlier, it ran correctly
DONE the distances traveled are not the same, so the descent and approach needs to be adjusted to make sure the aircraft travels the amount the airport distances are apart from each other.  the forced descent at an approximate distance from the destination is creating the artifact.  we should ut a "make up segment", like after the initial descent, so that the trigonomotery based calculations from the touchdown point, using the ROD and speeds for the remaining segments, can be correted during the make up " segment. if there is a headwind, then the makeup segment will allow the aircraft to level off for a bit until the trig works out.  if a tailwind, then the make up segment will allow a slow descnet until the trig works out so the destination is reached at the proper distance from the airport. is not by passed.
DONEi want cdo and k sliders for autobias and manual bias. autobias should prioritize the SFC and thrust, and i want the cdo and k values to show up over the slider bar and then adjust those 2 by percentage, not absolute.  plus or minus 10% in 1% increments, then the values about the slider would change.
i want a payload range diagram build first for the single run, and then the mission marked on it, then the rest of the plots.
i want the auto calibrate to be different.  the user will use a real world example for thier aircraft. and choose the fuel reserve, the ISA diff, the payload, the TOW, the FOB, the altitude flown and endureance (preferred) (or city pair with average winds). then the simulator should adjust he engine parameters to get that correct.  maybe we let the user decide how to calibrate, either by climb fuel and time, and cruise fuel burn at the altitude, (the present model) or the real endurance model i suggested
